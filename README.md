“Langar for Hunger” is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free meals to individuals and families in need. Inspired by the Sikh tradition of Langar, where meals are offered to all, irrespective of their background, Langar for Hunger aims to alleviate hunger and foster a sense of community through shared meals. Our mission is to ensure no one goes hungry and to create a supportive community that works together to overcome food insecurity. Langar for Hunger is a web platform that facilitates the collection of surplus food from restaurants and distributes it to those in need through a network of dedicated volunteers. The platform allows restaurants to easily register and schedule food donations, ensuring that surplus food is efficiently redirected to community centres, shelters, and food banks. Volunteers play a crucial role by coordinating the collection and delivery of these donations, ensuring timely and safe distribution. By leveraging technology and community effort, "Langar for Hunger" aims to reduce food waste and combat hunger, fostering a culture of sharing and support within the community.
